### Double Exponential Moving Average (DEMA)

The Double Exponential Moving Average (DEMA) reduces the lag of traditional EMAs, making it more responsive and better-suited for short-term traders. DEMA was developed by Patrick Mulloy, and introduced in the January 1994 issue of *Technical Analysis of Stocks & Commodities* magazine.

The overlay uses the lag difference between a single-smoothed EMA and a double-smoothed EMA to offset the single-smoothed EMA. This offset produces a moving average that remains smooth, but stays closer to the price bars than either the single- or double-smoothed traditional EMA.
