### Triple Exponential Moving Average (TEMA)

The Triple Exponential Moving Average (TEMA) reduces the lag of traditional EMAs, making it more responsive and better-suited for short-term trading. Shortly after developing the Double Exponential Moving Average (DEMA) in 1994, Patrick Mulloy took the concept a step further and created the Triple Exponential Moving Average (TEMA).

Like its predecessor DEMA, the TEMA overlay uses the lag difference between different EMAs to adjust a traditional EMA. However, TEMA's formula uses a triple-smoothed EMA in addition to the single- and double-smoothed EMAs employed in the formula for DEMA. The offset created using these three EMAs produces a moving average that stays even closer to the price bars than DEMA.
