### Know Sure Thing (KST)

Developed by Martin Pring, Know Sure Thing (KST) is a momentum oscillator based on the smoothed rate-of-change for four different timeframes. Pring first described the indicator in the 1992 “Summed Rate of Change (KST)” in *Stocks & Commodities* magazine. In short, KST measures price momentum for four different price cycles, combining them into a single momentum oscillator. Like any other unbound momentum oscillator, chartists can use KST to look for divergences, signal line crossovers, and centerline crossovers. Pring frequently applied trend lines to KST. Although trend line signals do not occur often, Pring notes that such breaks reinforce signal line crossovers.

- Short-term Daily = KST(10,15,20,30,10,10,10,15,9)
