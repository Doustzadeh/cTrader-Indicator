### Volatility Quality Index (VQI)

The volatility quality index (VQI) by *Thomas Stridsman* was firstly published in 2002 on Technical Analysis of Stocks and Commodities magazine.

The idea behind the volatility quality index is to point out the difference between bad and good volatility in order to identify better trade opportunities in the market.

This forex indicator works using the True Range algorithm in combination with the open, close, high and low prices.

*Stridsman* suggested to buy when VQI has increased in the previous 10 bars (use the SMA) and sell when it has decreased in the previous 10 bars. Use this with your other indicators as a confirmation signal.
