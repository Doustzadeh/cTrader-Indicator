### Projection Bands

Projection Bands were developed by Mel Widner, Ph.D and were introduced in an Technical Analysis of Stocks & Commodities magazine article in July, 1995.

Projection Bands are made up of two bands outlining minimum and maximum projected boundaries. The Bands are derived using the minimum and maximum prices over a given time period and projecting these forward, parallel to a linear regression line. The Bands are interpreted to signal directional price reversal when when prices reaches their boundary.
