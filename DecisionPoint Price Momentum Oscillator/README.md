### DecisionPoint Price Momentum Oscillator (PMO)

Developed by Carl Swenlin, the DecisionPoint Price Momentum Oscillator (PMO) is an oscillator based on a Rate of Change (ROC) calculation that is smoothed twice with exponential moving averages that use a custom smoothing process. Because the PMO is normalized, it can also be used as a relative strength tool. Stocks can thus be ranked by their PMO value as an expression of relative strength.

An indicator that looks very similar to the PMO is the MACD (Moving Average Convergence-Divergence) indicator invented by Gerald Appel. The main difference between the PMO and MACD is the absolute value of each indicator.
