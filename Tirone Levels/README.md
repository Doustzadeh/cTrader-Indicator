### Tirone Levels

Tirone Levels are a series of horizontal lines that identify support and resistance levels. They were developed by John Tirone.

Tirone Levels can be drawn using either the Midpoint 1/3-2/3 method or the Mean method. Both methods are intended to help you identify potential support and resistance levels based on the range of prices over a given time period. The interpretation of Tirone Levels is similar to Quadrant Lines.
