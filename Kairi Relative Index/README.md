### Kairi Relative Index (KRI)

The Kairi Relative Index is an old Japanese metric with unknown origins and waning popularity in the modern day due to more popular indicators such as Welles Wilder's Relative Strength Index (RSI). Traders since the late 1970s have grown accustomed to newer, more modern indicators.

Because Kairi has an unknown derivation and is used much less even in certain Japanese indicator loyalty zones of Russia and Asia, its continued use is curious. Add the fact that literally no early writings can be found regarding Kairi. The word itself translates to separate or dissociation. We don't want deviation in our indicators or price separation; we want perfect market timing indicators that follow market trends and turns. The difference between the two indicators is slight and yet varied, the only way to understand the Kairi Index is to compare it with the RSI.

To begin with, both are considered oscillators. Oscillator indicators move with a chart line up or down as markets fluctuate. Calculations vary among each oscillator, so each oscillator serves a different market function. RSI and Kairi serve as momentum oscillators and are considered leading indicators. Momentum oscillators measure market prices' rate of change. As prices rise, momentum increases, and a decrease measures a decrease in momentum. Momentum is reflected both in the manner that RSI and Kairi operate and in their calculations.
