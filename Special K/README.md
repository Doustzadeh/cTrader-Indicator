### Martin Pring's Special K

Created by Martin Pring, Special K is a momentum indicator that combines short-, intermediate- and long-term velocity into one complete series, thereby giving us true summed cyclicality. It has two functions: first, to identify primary trend reversals at a relatively early stage; second, to use that information for timing short-term pro-trend price moves.
